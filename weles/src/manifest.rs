//! Fleet composition machinery — the runtime TYPES and wiring for a fleet, now
//! that the fleet DATA (process names, ports, boot order, per-process env) lives
//! in an operator-authored `fleet.toml` parsed by [`crate::fleet_toml`]. This
//! module owns [`ServiceDef`]/[`Addrs`]/[`AddrKind`], the one address formatter
//! [`service_addr`], the peer-address derivation ([`peer_addr`],
//! [`PeerAddrs`]), and the env composer [`compose_env_with_fleet`] — everything
//! that turns a parsed fleet slice into what a service is spawned with. It no
//! longer holds the fleet itself: `fleet_toml::load` produces the `Vec` this
//! machinery operates on.
//!
//! The `Vec` order IS the boot order — dependencies are expressed implicitly by
//! position: every [`AddrKind::Edge`] entry in a service's [`Addrs::Told`] list
//! must appear strictly EARLIER in the Vec (enforced by
//! [`crate::fleet_toml::validate`]). An [`AddrKind::Http`] entry carries NO such
//! constraint — it is a passthrough ORIGIN, dialed per request rather than at
//! boot.
//!
//! **`Addrs::Asks` (the managed front door):** gateway-svc asks the agent where
//! its peers are (via [`ORCHESTRATOR_URL_ENV`]) instead of being told by env, so
//! it declares no peer list. The boot-order rule does not constrain a service
//! from its own declaration when it declares none, and the dual-kind provider
//! (`accounts`, edge + http) is proven through [`PeerAddrs`] — where the gateway
//! now actually reads it.
//!
//! Deliberate delta vs `tools/processctl/src/fleet.rs`'s Development flavor:
//! weles's composed env is fully deterministic — the `overrideable_env` seam
//! (which lets ambient `SCHEDULER_ENABLED`/… override the manifest) was
//! consciously NOT ported, per the config-as-code decision: what a service gets
//! is exactly what its `fleet.toml` `[service.env]` says, plus the always-on
//! [`SERVICE_ENV_ALLOWLIST`] floor and the fleet's `passthrough` keys.
